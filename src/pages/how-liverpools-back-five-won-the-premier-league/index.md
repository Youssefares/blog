Less than 3 years ago, Jurgen Klopp fielded a back five that comprised Simone Mignolet, Dejan Lovren, Joel Matip, Alberto Moreno and non specialist Joe Gomez at right back on a premier league visit to Wembley. [The result on the day](https://twitter.com/guardian_sport/status/922180812770041858) seems like a very distant memory now.

**And despite we all knowing how Liverpool have fared since then, this is one more attempt at telling the story.**

## Title-winning Defence
As Mauricio Pochettino struggled to make a midfield pair out of Harry Winks and "failed signing" Moussa Sissoko, Liverpool went on to spend 75 million pound to sign [a certain Dutch center half](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/42496637).

A few months afterwards, Trent Alexander-Arnold showed his worth nullifying Leroy Sane as Liverpool knocked Man City out of the champions league and became the youngest liverpool player to ever start [a champions league final](https://twitter.com/Football__Tweet/status/1252504845464088577).

Andrew Roberton was meanwhile evolving slowly from an understudy to Alberto Moreno to the teams first choice left back and Karius' mistakes were enough to warrant a £66.9m investment in now liverpool first choice goalkeeper Alisson Becker.

By GW15 this season, liverpool were already 11 points ahead of Man City. Then, followed a run of games where Alisson kept 10 clean sheets out of a possible 11 extending the gap to 18 points. **At that point**:

>1. Man City had scored 6 goals more than Liverpool'd managed but conceded 14 more.
>2. Liverpool had conceded SIXTEEN goals less than they had, just 2 seasons before.

The competition was all but over.

## Flying fullbacks
Kevin De Bruyne leads the league in [Assists/90](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-8505971/Its-Kevin-Bruyne-vs-Thierry-Henry-emerge-time-assist-king.html). He also leads the league in [xA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4kNa1cUvZM)/90, Goals+Assists/90  & Key Passes and is second in Goal Creating Actions/90 only to teammate Riyad Mahrez. It's only logical oppositions will look to shut down the Belgian and Man City's gradual dependence on his creativity will ultimately hurt them.

Liverpool had a difference source of creativity this season and two fullbacks who've edged their Man City counterparts by miles in terms of passing the ball.

TAA's passing output alone's been surpassing the sum of both of Man City's fullbacks. Meanwhile, Andrew Robertson's been himself an unsung playmaker, having just registered his 20th assist over 2 seasons against Brighton.

It's no surprise that Atletico Madrid posed a very strong challenge to liverpool in the champions league. Atletico madrid two banks of four could on their day nullify any pair of wingbacks or fullbacks, but while on the subject, liverpool fans have been very vocal about Adrian's contributions to their early exit. Are they right?

## The last wall standing that is Alisson Becker
Even if somehow you're able to get a good shot on target against liverpool (and [a look at the numbers](https://twitter.com/rogue_wee/status/1224662330820169728) say that's very difficult), You're still tasked with beating a very devastating Alisson Becker.

[Post Shot Expected Goals (PSxG)](https://statsbomb.com/2018/11/a-new-way-to-measure-keepers-shot-stopping-post-shot-expected-goals/) enables us to look at how much a keeper saves on a regular basis. There are three takeways here:

1. Alisson's higher amount of goals saved compared to Ederson (despite having played less) introduces another big difference between the two teams.
2. Those liverpool supporters are right about Adrian. Adrian (1.03) conceded a significantly larger amount of goals that Alisson(0.66) allows per game. This ratio was almost 2:1 before City's recent thrashing of the reds. Adrian has a lower saver percentage and almost half the Clean Sheet Ratio that Klopp has come to expect under Alisson.
3. Hugo Lloris is an absolute beast. His goals saved are now up to 9, leading the league despite missing out on most of the season before lockdown with injury. Tottenham's very shaky backline, of course, contributes to this very weird outlier.

**So goals saved and goals conceded set City and Liverpool apart. Liverpools playmaking fullbacks set City and Liverpool apart.**

Nabi Keita or ['Nabi lad'](https://twitter.com/LFC/status/1252612555354312705) is yet to get a consistent spell of starting XI football. He's the one player in the squad who'd you expect the most improvement of. That along with the imminent signing of Thiago Alcantara promises a lot of choice for Liverpool's midfield which's arguably at times liverpool's weakest link. Keeping these two fit will be key to introducing more playmaking solutions from the side's midfield.

The 2020/2021 season will surely be unique in multiple dimensions, but Guardiola will have to look to bridge the gap between his side's defending and that of their Merseyside rivals.

What I want is to try to play good and score goals and arrive more, so what&#39;s tackles?&quot; <a href="https://t.co/BcjoXg307c">pic.twitter.com/BcjoXg307c</a></p>&mdash; The Pep (@GuardiolaTweets) <a href="https://twitter.com/GuardiolaTweets/status/1128406265980497928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2019</a></blockquote>

Is it time for Guardiola to start "training the tackles"?

# [matplotflick.io](https://matplotflick.io/)

My personal blog. Forked from [Dan Abramov's overreacted.io](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io). Syntax theme loosely based on [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme/) with small tweaks.

To run locally, `yarn`, then `yarn dev`, then open https://localhost:8000.
